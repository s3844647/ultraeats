In this assignment I have aimed to implement a food delivery application similar to Uber Eats, using React.js, Spring Boot and various services from AWS.
This application is UNFINISHED and does not work properly.

--Script information--
The jar file in the deployment folder is used to run the Elastic Beanstalk application off.

Also, there are the RDSConfig and S3Config Java files. These were run on my local account to create the instances.

--References--
Some code based on the Bookeroo project.
